Redux Toolkit is a package that simplifies the process of managing state in a Redux-based application. Redux is a popular library for managing state in JavaScript applications, particularly in React applications, but it can sometimes be verbose and require boilerplate code.

configureStore: Redux Toolkit provides a configureStore function that combines several Redux-related settings, including creating the Redux store, applying middleware (such as Redux Thunk for async actions), and enabling Redux DevTools Extension.

createSlice: This utility function allows developers to define Redux state slices, including the initial state and reducers, in a more concise and readable manner. It automatically generates action creators based on the reducers.

createAsyncThunk: A utility for creating async action creators that dispatch other actions based on the outcome of asynchronous operations (e.g., API calls). It is commonly used with Redux Thunk middleware.

By using Redux Toolkit, developers can write Redux code more efficiently, with less boilerplate and fewer opportunities for common mistakes. It's especially useful for developers who are new to Redux or who prefer a more opinionated approach to managing state in their applications.
